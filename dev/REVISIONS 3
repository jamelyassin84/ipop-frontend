Population Profile By Municipality
No. of HHs - same with Total Population - Sex Ratio has different formats (104, 101:42, 104:100, 102/100) - Some Total Population has only 2 figures (ex Badiangan 28 instead of 29,306)

# Additional Feature

Cannot change (Some of the features that were requested could not be added since backend's data structure was already planned, implemented and it is somehow irreversible when there is data on it.):

Type of Marriages Graph
Graph is in 2022? (This only accept provincial Data)

Death
Crude Death Rate Chart fetch data from Local Death Data (This only accept provincial Data)

Incidence of Teenage Births Graph
Seems static - i tried encoding leganes 2021 incidence of teenage births of 13, the graph still unchanged (This only accept provincial Data)

Incidence of Illegitimate, Teenage and Crude death rate are just provincial data, no feature for municipal or barangay as per last year's review. (This only accept provincial Data)
